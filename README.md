# Customer-Segmentation
Customer segmentation allows organizations to divide a market into subsets  of customers that have, 
or are perceived to have, common needs, interests, and priorities â€“ then design and implement strategies 
targeted toward them. An essential tool, segmentation helps organizations serve low-income markets by 
understanding important common characteristics of their customer base, which can make the difference 
between an underutilized service and one that resonates with customers.
